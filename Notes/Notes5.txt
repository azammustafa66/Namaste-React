- Giving key props is very important else React re-renders every component in the DOM and each key should be unique
- React's official doc says not to use index as key

How React works behind the scenes
- It uses Reconciliation Algorithm or React Fibre

What does react do when you use a hook?
- It copies DOM and creates a virtual DOM (virtual DOM is just a representation of original DOM). It changes the data in the virtual DOM.

So now what is virtual DOM?
- It is an object of the functional component that the trans piler compiles as HTML elements
